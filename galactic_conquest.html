<p>One of the best game modes of Battlefront 2 is galactic conquest. This gamemode is my favorite because of all the ways to dunk on the enemey team. There are bounes and different bouneses to give you an edge in the fight, different classes with different guns and equepment. The big opjective of this mode is to take over the galexy and at the same time keep the enemy from doing the same thing. My favorite class is the sniper class, equped with a high caliber rifle that can one shot anyone in the head and two shots anywhere else
