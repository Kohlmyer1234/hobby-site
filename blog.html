<p>I got this game a few years (I was 10) back when my friend family moved away to new york to be closer to her brother who was in collage</p>
<br>
<p> when they where cleaning out the brothers room they stoped at our house and gave left the games on the door step. a few months pass and I fing them when i was borded and looking for something to do. I found the game under my bed, grabed it and popped the disk in to my desktop computer, I played it for hours and hours the amount of times i played that game where insane in the membrane.</p>  
<br>
<br>
<p>I will now talk about the different game modes I talked about it the home page. My favorite game mode is galactic conquest, galactic conquest, this gamemode is so fun it will have it own page. Next is the campain, the campain in my expert opinion is actually well-doen it is a challaging but also fun game giving you time and stratigey to think about what to do. Lastly I will talk about the instant action. Insant action is like a quick private match with all the different game modes. conquest, Xl asllault and hunt.</p>
